# Writing content

There is no requirements on where to put content, but a best practice is the following:

- Place each page in a folder
- Inside the folder, include everything related to that page: files, images...
    - Place files in a `files/` folder, this is important to make the files download-able
- Don't use spaces in folder or file names

Leverage the best practices for [writing exercises](../pages/21-writing-exercises/README.md) and [writing markdown](../pages/20-writing-markdown/README.md) to make the exercises look good.
